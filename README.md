## inspiration

It's very easy to just throw your money in your pocket and just assume you're fine. I did that for too long. About four years ago I made a relatively simple spreadsheet to keep better track of my income. I find it to be extremely powerful to be able to estimate you're income when the majority of your income is seemingly random.

## future iterations

*   calculate pre and post tax income
*   look at monthly and yearly income history and more data related
*   give users ability to set goals per week or month
*   better authentication and encryption
*   Most importantly, build a native version of this app

## tech used

*   React.js
